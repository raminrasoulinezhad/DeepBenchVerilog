To generate the CNN models, Please read the `README.md` fils in both `hls4ml_wrapper` and `keras_generator` directories. 

Files and folders hierarchies:

    CNNs
    ├── RFNoC-HLS-NeuralNet_example --> to use old versions of HLS4ML tools
    ├── keras_generator		--> to generate required Keras model (it will be the input for HLS4ML tool)
	└── hls4ml_wrapper      --> To generate verilog files from the Keras models
